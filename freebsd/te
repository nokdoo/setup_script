<RhodiumToad> oh, someone else with a linux printer driver
<RhodiumToad> what printer, out of interest?
<nokdoot> Samsung M2024
<nokdoot> SL-M2024
<RhodiumToad> I have a samsung ML1670
<RhodiumToad> what I do currently is that I have the linux binary of the driver in the freebsd file tree, having figured out what files to put where from the install script
<RhodiumToad> what I did before with an older version of the driver was to install all of linux cups (not just the client) inside /compat/linux, and install the driver in there too
<RhodiumToad> but that needed some fairly painful fiddling with things
<nokdoot> I just used ppd file when I add printer on cups page, but printer's status was idle, and it did not work :<
<RhodiumToad> what binaries are there in the driver package?
<RhodiumToad> hm, it might even be the same driver I have? what's the driver filename?
* Offering 'uld_v1.00.36_00.91.tar.gz' to RhodiumToad
<nokdoot> I downloaded this
<RhodiumToad> it's the exact same one I have
<RhodiumToad> you can get it working, or should be able to, by just installing 3 files
<nokdoot> Ohh..
<RhodiumToad> rastertospl goes in /usr/local/libexec/cups/filter
<RhodiumToad> libscmssc.so  goes in /compat/linux/usr/lib64
<RhodiumToad> and then the .ppd for your printer model goes in /usr/local/share/cups/model/samsung  or you can just upload it into cups from the admin screen
<RhodiumToad> I even made a port to install mine for me
<RhodiumToad> oh, you need a bunch of linux packages to be installed
<RhodiumToad> base cups-libs gnutls avahi-libs tiff png libgcrypt jpeg libgpg-error libtasn1 dbuslibs
<RhodiumToad> i.e. linux-c6-*  for all of those
<nokdoot> Ahhhhh hahaha it's hard to follow haha
<RhodiumToad> you don't actually need dbus to be running, afaik, but the libs have to be there
<nokdoot> YOu mean, I have to install them from pkg?
<RhodiumToad> yes, or ports if that's your thing
<nokdoot> It's my time for setting FreeBSD, so I don't know what they do, I'm just following you.. and I will check them later
<nokdoot> You said, cups-libs, avahi-libs, dbuslibs. You meant cups-*, avahi-*, dbus-* ?? there is no *-libs for them on pkg 
<RhodiumToad> hmm?
<RhodiumToad> which repo?
<RhodiumToad> linux-c6-cups-libs-*  for example
<RhodiumToad> linux-c6-avahi-libs-*  etc.
<RhodiumToad> those should all be in the pkg repos
<nokdoot> Ahhh I thought just 'cups-libs', not linux-c6-cups-libs
<nokdoot> I will do it
<RhodiumToad> you need the linux versions of those packages so that the rastertospl and libscmssc.so linux binaries can find all the linux libraries that they depend on
<nokdoot> Umm.. linux-c6-tiff and png are missing
<RhodiumToad> um
<RhodiumToad> sec
<RhodiumToad> there are ports for both, I don't know why the packages would be missing
<RhodiumToad> which repo are you on?
<RhodiumToad> ohh
<RhodiumToad> looks like the package names may have changed to libpng and libtiff
<RhodiumToad> try linux-c6-libpng  etc.
<nokdoot> Ahh yesyes I just found out too
<nokdoot> I searched tiff, not linux-c6 :> haha
<nokdoot> Hm... almost things already installed, I just installed dbus-libs now
<RhodiumToad> right, most linux stuff needs most of those things
<RhodiumToad> if you tried printing anything before installing all this, you'll probably have to enable and start the printer from the cups interface
<nokdoot> It does not work, so I'm searching log on Online :<
<RhodiumToad> a couple of quick checks: if you try and run /usr/local/libexec/cups/filter/rastertospl   what happens?
<nokdoot> https://pastebin.com/WUATNJrP
<VimDiesel> Title: root@blogvillain:/usr/local/libexec/cups/filter # ./rastertospl INFO: Usage: r - Pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
<nokdoot> what that arguments...?
<RhodiumToad> that's ok, just checking it's executable and it finds all of its libraries
<RhodiumToad> it's intended to be run by cups, which provides the arguments
<RhodiumToad> what's the output from  lpstat -a   and  lpstat -p   ?
<nokdoot> Samsung_M2020_Series accepting requests since Sat Apr 27 17:35:02 2019 //// printer Samsung_M2020_Series is idle.  enabled since Sat Apr 27 17:35:02 2019
<RhodiumToad> hm. that looks ok. but it's not printing?
<nokdoot> Yes
<RhodiumToad> does /usr/local/bin/lpq  show anything queued?
<RhodiumToad> and how did you try to print?
<nokdoot> print on any web site
<nokdoot> On log, localhost - - [27/Apr/2019:17:56:10 +0900] "POST /printers/Samsung_M2020_Series HTTP/1.1" 200 42849 Print-Job client-error-document-format-not-supported
<RhodiumToad> try something like  echo "test!" | lpr-cups   first
<nokdoot> lpr-cups: Error - unable to access "first" - No such file or directory
<RhodiumToad> that's not part of the command
<RhodiumToad> just  echo "test!" | lpr-cups
<nokdoot> lpr-cups: Error - No default printer.
<RhodiumToad> if you haven't installed the cups-filters package (the freebsd one, not the linux one) you probably need it
<RhodiumToad> echo "test!" | lpr-cups Samsung_M2020_Series
<RhodiumToad> er no
<RhodiumToad> I can never remember the command
<nokdoot> Yes, cups-filters I did not install
<nokdoot> I'm installing it
<RhodiumToad> you'll probably want to set your default printer at some point
* fstd_ is now known as fstd
<nokdoot> Yesyes
-NickServ- nokdoot_!~nokdoot@211.205.207.39 has just authenticated as you (nokdoot)
<RhodiumToad> any luck?
<nokdoot_> I'm about to reboot
<nokdoot> .
